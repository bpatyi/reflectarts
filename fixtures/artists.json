This nostalgic surreal atmosphere present in her art work is led by a feminine principle-the Mother Goddess-which is surrounded by a disturbing and intriguing world in constant change and transformation. The infant-image appears always in regressive, and fragmentation and multiplication is part of the construction process in which mutilated arms and heads often appear. In these moments her work becomes layered with multifaceted echoes surrounded by a sinister romanticism; however, at other times, the mutation is prolific and new forms emerge: a doll's torso \"gives birth to a second, the second, in turn, bears a third, in a constantly ongoing movement like The cycle of Ouroboros: The serpent that eats it's own tail.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<div><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>", "image": "", "selected": true, "updated_at": "2013-05-22 05:46:16", "slug": "Naury-Joaquin", "email": "info@reflectarts.com", "website_url": "http://naury-artwork.30art.com/"}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "artists.artist", "fields": {"created_at": "2013-05-22 04:51:41", "first_name": "Agni", "last_name": "Zotis", "description": "<p><span>1993 -

Caught in an amorphous world of childhood images and texts, the children peer out at us from deep in the past. As we contemplate at these elegant but anonymous portraits, we are forced to consider human identity and its impact over time.</span><br /><br /><span>French poet Andre Breton began his first surrealist novel, Nadja, by considering the relationship between the self and the haunting presences that define the self. &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If this once I were to rely on a proverb, then perhaps everything would amount to knowing whom I &lsquo;haunt&rsquo;.&rdquo; The children in late nineteenth century photographs haunt Pearce in the same way that the gamine Nadja haunted Breton.</span><br /><br /><span>Because Pearce transforms the small, dusty photographs into beautifully limned paintings, the children begin to haunt us as well. Who was this child, dressed in white, standing solemnly before a graffiti-soiled wall? Did she become a woman, have children of her own? Who was this ghostly boy with preternaturally white skin and waist-long white hair? Why did his parents not trim his frazzled locks? Why is his face so deeply marked by despair? And who were these two blonde children, dressed in blue, staring so seriously back at us? What about the older child with dark straight hair, the one whose face and torso hovers, disembodied in a golden cloud that rains broken teeth? Who were these children?&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Pearce uses traditional painting processes, laying multiple thin layers over deep chiaroscuro underpainting. Light enters the multiple layers of oil and pigment glaze, finds the dark background and shimmers back at us in ghostly evanescence. The artist&rsquo;s canny use of Renaissance techniques enhances the marvelous presence of her images. They recall another of Breton&rsquo;s famous assertions: &ldquo;The marvelous is always beautiful, anything marvelous is beautiful, in fact only the marvelous is beautiful!&rdquo;</span></p>", "image": "", "selected": true, "updated_at": "2013-05-22 05:45:46", "slug": "Carrie-Pearce", "email": "info@reflectarts.com", "website_url": "http://carriepearce.com/"}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "artists.artist", "fields": {"created_at": "2013-05-22 04:55:10", "first_name": "Jordan", "last_name": "Betten", "description": "<p><span>Jordan Betten is the founder of Lost Art and Betten Art.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>Lost Art, a luxury leather couture brand, began in 1997 with the creation of his first hand made bag, called &ldquo;The Road&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Soon after, Betten was designing clothing and accessories for Lenny Kravitz, Steven Tyler, Sean Lennon, Sheryl Crow and many others.&nbsp; His work has been featured in numerous publications, such as Vogue, W, Rolling Stone and ELLE.</span></p>\r\n<p>Betten Art was launched in 2005 to encompass his&nbsp; use of other creative mediums, including painting, drawing, and sculpture.&nbsp;&nbsp; His work has been compared to Jackson Pollock and Picasso.</p>", "image": "", "selected": false, "updated_at": "2013-05-22 04:55:10", "slug": "Jordan-Betten", "email": "info@reflectarts.com", "website_url": "http://www.bettenart.com/"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "artists.artist", "fields": {"created_at": "2013-05-22 04:55:35", "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Santini", "description": "<p><span>Michael Santini's artwork is an allegorica portrayal of the constant spiritual and worldly struggle of good versus&nbsp; evil. \"As in reality, the elements and characters in my work exist&nbsp; within a constant, yet ever changing boundary, rearranging them in each&nbsp; new piece.

Her creations embody the stark contrast and disparity of native traditions such as the duty of remembrance, the lives of ancestors through mind and blood-lineage, and their presence beyond death, with the bleak history of a colonial society. The artist's native New Zealand is a country isolated from the homogenizing currents of international exposure where the strains of a very recent migrant history and a fractious cultural interface has created a unique culture and conceptual influence in her work.<br /><br />Her large-scale figurative charcoal drawings are distinguished for the inscrutable, monumental, still figures which occupy a middle-distance; an inaccessible space visually created by dense black fields combined with graceful lines. These imposing large-scale works (8'x 5') combine an intense, powerful and unyielding dramatic presence with a subtle emotional complexity creating layers of communication between drawing and viewer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In tangent, her delicate ink work captures tiny figures caught in fluid, seeping black, which visually enact bizarre narratives in these small (11\" x 9\") drawings on paper and duralar. These narratives are formed intuitively, running and turning in the flowing of the ink, resulting in strange, quirky, picaresque scenes representing the fraught memories of fragmented lives. The unsettled ghosts and lost souls of her inheritance inhabit her figures, visually generating power, grace, loneliness and fragility who play out the narratives of Ms. Taurerewa's work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Taurerewa spends her time in both New York and New Zealand. She has been exhibiting internationally for close to a decade and has been in over thirty shows. Lorene recently completed a Residency at the National Art Studio of the Korean National Museum of Contemporary Art. She has recently exhibited in Los Angeles&nbsp;&nbsp;at the New Zealand Consulate General residency and will be exhibiting at the Queensland Art Gallery in Australia in 2009. She is part of private and public collections world-wide, with recent acquisitions including the Queensland Art Gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia, and the James Wallace Arts Trust in New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, Lorene is going to be a subject in an upcoming New Zealand arts documentary Lorene Taurerewa, produced by Kirsty McDonald, the filming of which will coincide with and take place at the opening of this exhibition.</p>", "image": "", "selected": false, "updated_at": "2013-05-22 05:00:03", "slug": "Lorene-Taurerewa", "email": "info@reflectarts.com", "website_url": "http://taurerewa.com/"}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "artists.artist", "fields": {"created_at": "2013-05-22 05:01:36", "first_name": "Simone", "last_name": "Zimmermann", "description": "", "image": "", "selected": true, "updated_at": "2013-05-22 05:45:16", "slug": "Simone-Zimmermann", "email": "sim935@gmail.com", "website_url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/117748296497068920956/albums/5877575027024921089?authkey=CI2Q06br2ojmrAE"}}, {"pk": 10, "model": "artists.artist", "fields": {"created_at": "2013-05-22 05:02:06", "first_name": "Arne", "last_name": "Drescher", "description": "", "image": "", "selected": true, "updated_at": "2013-05-22 05:45:04", "slug": "Arne-Drescher", "email": "arnevvny@gmail.com", "website_url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/117748296497068920956/albums/5877576679539762161?authkey=CNOE7sWVgIK6CQ"}}]
